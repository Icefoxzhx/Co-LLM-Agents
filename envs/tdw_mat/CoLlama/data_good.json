By doing this, we will have transported all required oranges and burgers and 4 out of 4 required loaf_breads to the bed. We will then be left with two apples to find and transport. Since the kitchen and the bedroom have been fully explored without finding any more apples, it's logical to explore the remaining rooms for the apples. However, considering the steps taken so far, it would be more efficient to transport the objects in the container to the bed first before going to another room.

Since Bob has already explored the Livingroom (2000) and Livingroom (1000), the best option is to explore a new room. The cost of going to the Bedroom (3000), Kitchen (4000), Office (6000), and the other Livingroom (5000, 7000) are likely similar. Choosing one of them is the best available action. In this case, Bob should prioritize rooms that are more likely to contain the remaining items, such as the Office (6000) for calculators and a mouse, and the Bedroom (3000) for a purse, a lighter, and an iPhone. \n\nNext, Bob should communicate with Alice to coordinate their efforts. It's better to divide the rooms between them to save steps. \n\nSo, the best available action is a combination of two actions: go to a new room and send a message to Alice. The message should inform Alice of Bob's current situation and ask her to explore the other rooms. \n\nSo, the best available action is:\n\nAction: First, go to <Office> (6000)."

I can hold two things at a time, and they can be objects or containers. I can grasp containers and put objects into them to hold more objects at a time. Given our shared goal, dialogue history, my progress, and previous actions, please help me choose the best available action to achieve the goal as soon as possible. Note that a container can contain three objects, and will be lost once transported to the bed. I can only put objects into the container I hold after grasping it. All objects are denoted as <name> (id), such as <table> (712). Actions take several steps to finish. It may be costly to go to another room or transport to the bed, use these actions sparingly.\nGoal: Transport 4 burgers, 1 apple, 2 breads, 3 bananas to the bed.\nProgress: I've taken 2838/3000 steps.
